### Learn To Code

Welcome to the Learn To Code Workshop. For the upcoming 4 days we will spend together, we will explore some techniques used by professional developers during their development process. The idea with this workshop is to showcase some of those techniques and put them in to practice.

The application we will build is a tool to administrate, issue and verify course certificates.

#### Problem definition
*** As an education institution/company, I face a growing problem with aggregating course and student's information, and issue appropriate course certificates. I also want to make sure that certificates I issue are not tampered with by bad people, that want to take credit for a course they actually did not attend. ***

#### The Learning Experience

What makes this application interesting as a learning experience is that it solves a relatively simple problem but requires implementation of several technologies in order to be completed.
We are going to use:

- A database for storing data (PostgreSQL)
- Data import functionality
- A back-end framework (Sinatra)
- A library to generate pdf files
- A library to generate images
- An encryption library
- A cloud storage service (Amazon Web Services)
- A Platform as a Service provider (Heroku)
- Email functionality and service to distribute documents (Gmail)
- JavaScript (jQuery) to add functionality and to enhance the user experience on the front-end
- A CSS framework (Foundation) to style the front-end
- And more...

We will be moving in a rather fast phase but we will take good time to explain everything we do. The most important thing is that you follow us as we move forward. The best way to start to learn to code is.. to code! Even if you don't understand everything, we'd like you to do your best to actually go through the steps in this guide. There's no bigger joy than to see code you've written pass all the tests and come to life in your browser.

Tests? Yes! We will be practicing *Behavior Driven Development* with a mix of *Unit tests*. This is to ensure that our application meets the requirements (more on that later).

### Open Source
This publication contains the course materials we ask all our future students to go through. You are free to use it for your personal learning needs even if you are not attending our workshop, we encourage that. 

**It is however not allowed to use this material in a commercial context without our written consent. It is not okay and it is against the very meaning of open source.**

We hope that you will enjoy this material and that the learning experience will be valuable to you.
