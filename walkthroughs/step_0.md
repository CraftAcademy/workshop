### User stories

##### The format

```
  As a <role>
  So that/In order to <business value>
  I want to <feature>
```

The above user story format is the one we will be using to describe the application. It is centered around three important questions:

- Who's using the system?
- What are they doing?
- Why do they care?

##### Examples
These are some initial user stories that we will be working with. In a real project we would spend a couple of hours to a week defining user stories and breaking them down to features and scenarios. For the purpose of this exercise, we will add user stories along the way as we progress.
