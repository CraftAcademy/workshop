##### The look and feel

Up until now we have been developing our application using tests - features and specs. Now is the time to start a browser and have a look at the application.
Brace yourself - you might be surprised. ;-)

In your terminal run the following command:

```shell
rackup
```

You should get an output that looks something like this:

```shell
[2015-11-18 21:56:22] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2015-11-18 21:56:22] INFO  ruby 2.2.0 (2014-12-25) [x86_64-darwin14]
[2015-11-18 21:56:22] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=46170 port=9292
```

Now, open up your browser and type in `http://localhost:9292` in the address field.

Ta ta! What you see is some raw html pages. There is no colors and no styling on the pages.

So, browse around... Don't mind the raw look and feel of the pages you see. Focus on the functionality. It is all there.

Functionality is important - it's the backbone of an application. That goes without saying. But we consume with our eyes and the look and feel of an application is also important.
